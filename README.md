# Hi, I'm Angelo 👋🏾

> **The Journey:** I spent half a decade selling AI and software to the world before deciding to build it myself. In **June 2025**, I made the definitive pivot from **SDR to Software Developer**, embracing the "learn by building" philosophy.
>
> Instead of fighting syntax, I **build in tandem with AI** via structured system instructions, ensuring I navigate complex frameworks correctly to achieve **senior-level architectural quality** from day **one**.

### ## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Focused on Progressive Web Apps & Modern UI/UX)

I specialize in building high-performance **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** — fast, reliable, installable web experiences that feel native. My stack emphasizes React ecosystem tools for scalable, type-safe frontends, with flexible backends and strong attention to clean, modern UI/UX.

| Layer          | Technology                          | Notes / Infrastructure                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend / Web** | React • Next.js • TypeScript       | Core for building responsive, SEO-friendly PWAs and web apps                           |
| **Styling & UI Components** | Tailwind CSS • shadcn/ui           | Utility-first styling + beautiful, accessible, customizable components                 |
| **Mobile / Cross-Platform** | React Native • Expo                | For native-like mobile apps (with PWA overlap via web tech)                            |
| **Backend / Database** | Supabase                           | PostgreSQL-powered relational backend with auth, storage, real-time                   |
| **Backend / Real-time** | Firebase                           | NoSQL document storage, authentication, cloud functions, real-time sync               |
| **UI/UX Inspiration & Design** | Mobbin                             | For discovering high-quality mobile/web UI patterns and flows                          |
| **AI-Assisted Builders & Accelerated Prototyping** | Lovable.dev • Google AI Studio  • V0   | Exploring prompt-to-app tools (generate React + Tailwind + shadcn UIs from natural language) |

### Key Focus Areas
- **Progressive Web Apps** — offline support, push notifications, home-screen installability  
- **Modern UI/UX** — leveraging Tailwind + shadcn for rapid, consistent, accessible designs  
- **Type Safety & Scalability** — TypeScript everywhere for maintainable code  
- **AI-Augmented Development** — experimenting with tools that output React-based code to speed up ideation and prototyping  

Always open to expanding into new areas — currently deepening React ecosystem mastery while staying curious about AI-driven workflows.

### 🧠 Personality & Work Ethic

* **SDR Grit:** I bring a sales-hustle mentality to the terminal. I don't stop until the solution is shipped.
* **AI-Augmented:** I treat AI as a Senior Pair Programmer, using custom system instructions to maintain **Senior-level code quality**.
* **Product-Minded:** Because I've sold software, I build with a deep empathy for the user's "Jobs to be Done."
