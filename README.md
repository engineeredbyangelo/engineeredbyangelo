# Hi, I'm Angelo 👋🏾

## About Me

For over 3.5 years, I worked as an SDR, selling AI and software solutions to companies around the world. I loved the hustle of understanding customer needs, communicating value, and closing deals, but I increasingly felt the pull to create the technology I was pitching.

In **June 2025**, I made the pivot: from salesperson to solo developer.

The mindset shift has been profound. Sales taught me to think in outcomes and relationships; building code is teaching me precision, patience, and systems thinking. I’m learning that progress comes less from perfect understanding upfront and more from shipping, breaking, and iterating.

I learn best by building real projects from scratch or rapidly prototyping powerful user interfaces with tools like Lovable. 

Alongside that, I deepen fundamentals on platforms like **Brilliant.org** and practice by forking open-source repositories, studying their structure, and experimenting with improvements.

Seven months in, I still feel like I’m just getting started, but every deploy reinforces the decision to make this change. 

I’m here to keep learning publicly, shipping consistently, and turning ideas into working products.

###  🛠️ Tech Stack (Focused on Progressive Web Apps & Modern UI/UX)

I specialize in building high-performance **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** - fast, reliable, installable web experiences that feel native. My stack emphasizes React ecosystem tools for scalable, type-safe frontends, with flexible backends and strong attention to clean, modern UI/UX.

| Layer          | Technology                          | Notes / Infrastructure                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend / Web** | React • Next.js • TypeScript • Vite       | Core for building responsive, SEO-friendly PWAs and web apps                           |
| **Styling & UI Components** | Tailwind CSS • shadcn/ui           | Utility-first styling + beautiful, accessible, customizable components                 |
| **Mobile / Cross-Platform** | React Native • Expo                | For native-like mobile apps (with PWA overlap via web tech)                            |
| **Backend / Database** | Supabase                           | PostgreSQL-powered relational backend with auth, storage, real-time                   |
| **Backend / Real-time** | Firebase • Convex                           | NoSQL document storage, authentication, cloud functions, real-time sync               |
| **UI/UX Inspiration & Design** | Mobbin • Figma • 21stdev                             | For discovering high-quality mobile/web UI patterns and flows                          |
| **AI-Assisted & Accelerated Prototyping** | Lovable             | Exploring prompt-to-app tools (generate React + Tailwind + shadcn UIs from natural language) |

### Key Focus Areas
- **Progressive Web Apps** - offline support, push notifications, home-screen installability  
- **Modern UI/UX** - leveraging Tailwind + shadcn for rapid, consistent, accessible designs  
- **Type Safety & Scalability** - TypeScript everywhere for maintainable code  
- **AI-Augmented Development** - experimenting with tools that output React-based code to speed up ideation and prototyping  

Always open to expanding into new areas -> currently deepening React ecosystem mastery while staying curious about AI-driven workflows.

### 🧠 Personality & Work Ethic

* **SDR Grit:** I bring a sales-hustle mentality to the terminal. I don't stop until the solution is shipped.
* **AI-Augmented:** I treat AI as a Senior Pair Programmer, using custom system instructions to maintain **Senior-level code quality**.
* **Product-Minded:** Because I've sold software, I build with a deep empathy for the user's "Jobs to be Done."
